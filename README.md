Welcome to the Task Manager [Using React]

It's fairly simple to use. You can 

1. Add a task by simply entering the title in the inpur field, choosing the task status and then clicking on the Add button.
    (Lookout for the task status, if you forget it, you will encounter an alert. Similarly, if you forget the task title, the application will not add or display any.)

2. For every task added, you can Delete it.

3. If a status is complete, the task is shown Faded. Pending tasks are highlighted.
